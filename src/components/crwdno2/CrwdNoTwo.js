                    <p>A crwdpoint is issued by a merchant and the name is registered on crwdfinance. </p>
                    <p>Personalized crwdpoints are assets that act like a special class of stock that acts like a negotiable bond. </p>
                    <p>They are tradeable on secondary markets</p>

                        <p>The tokens are trackable, verifiable and are backed by Utility Tokens accessed by both customers and vendors. They are secure and eliminate all the friction existing in the traditional coupon ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>This global coupon capacity environment is trust-less and permission-less and allows additional actors in the process; brands, users, and publishers. Brands shall be able to release less expensive coupon tokens based on excess capacity that are also easy to track and cannot be redeemed multiple numbers of times.</p>
                        <p>This is a compelling solution as in the  US alone, Almost 90% of consumers used coupons in 2020. Over half of consumers prefer getting coupons and discounts on their mobile devices. </p>
                        <p>Over 142 million US adults redeemed digital coupons in 2020. 68% of consumers believe that digital coupons generate loyalty.</p>
                        <p>crwdworld will issue a capacity coupon token, CCT, purchased using the Vogon Utility Token. Merchants propose the price per token and are released through crwdmarkets to as many users as possible. </p>
                        <p>The merchants sell excess capacity on days they might need revenue most. Customers purchase those tokens through the use of Utility Tokens.</p>
                        <p>The tokens are converted into Merchant Coins aligned with the sub-industry providing a stable index. </p>

                     <p>The Merchant Coins are digital currencies designed to maintain a direct one-to-one peg to a more stable underlying asset, like the vogonAg. The merchants can redeem those merchant coins by selling them or incentivizing employees and their vendors.  The Merchant Coins are designed to provide stable value and as a store of value and medium of exchange.</p>  
                     <p>They minimize volatility by maintaining collateral in the form of reserves of vogonAg, and provide steady value.</p> 
                     <p>The Merchant Coins can contribute to the value of the ecosystem through lending and investing, in a manner similar to traditional banks. </p>
                     <p>Investors are able to speculate on the volume of Merchant coins used by the sub-industry.</p>
                     <p>Merchant Coins tied to silver utility-backed tokens become the most important financing tools for merchants worldwide as they are redeemed before a product is shipped or services rendered. crwdworld takes a percentage% fee.</p>
                     <p>The initial number of crwdpoints tokens will be allocated at 500 million of an available 1 billion. As each vendor will be given an allocation for them to label, the remaining will stay in escrow, awaiting redistribution for the platform's best interest.</p>
