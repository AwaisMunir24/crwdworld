                <h4>Introducing Open, Honest, Stable Markets powered by accretive Tokenomics</h4>
                <p>In 1889, Friedrich von Wieser asserted in his book "The Elementary Theory of Value" that the highest principle of all economies is utility. The utility is imperfectly contained in value. The amount of utility contained is intimately associated with the idea of goods. Where value and utility come into conflict, utility must conquer; nothing in the nature of value could give it the ascendency.

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>CrowdPoint is defining the next era in finance. We are building a Blockchain Ecosystem. A blockchain ecosystem is a network of participants in a blockchain that share business objectives and processes. Today, the Business ecosystems run by big technology companies extract value for themselves. In our blockchain ecosystem, everyone extracts value.</p>
                    <p>The heart of the Blockchain Exchange is the data about the digital version of you. Your data is the basis for all eCommerce in the digital domain. It allows you to secure privacy, protects you from identity theft, and improves your financial performance on the Blockchain. In the Blockchain Ecosystem, your Decentralized iD (crwdid) has both "bullion" and numismatic" value based on your data's volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. </p>
                    <p>At CrowdPoint, we offer a clear market differentiator in our technology. It redefines decentralized, distributed, and blockchain database technology. We built an entirely new approach to creating a distributed cloud because </p>
                    <p>There were a lot of problems with existing blockchains, everything from multimedia transactions to multi-hour transactions, as is sometimes the case with current high-power consumption blockchains with an inferior ability to interact in any enterprise setting.</p>
                    <p>Our open public distributed cloud architecture includes a blockchain offering guest languages that allow for more efficient and effective smart contracts. It provides a freely competitive market where any buyer or seller may trade, and competition determines prices. Our Blockchain Ecosystem is an assembly of hyper-effective FinTech Companies that derive exponential efficiencies through sharing a meta and unified Blockchain protocol organized into 11 Market Sectors, 24 Industry Groups, 69 Industries, and 159 sub-industries. </p>
                    <p>Each subindustry leverages its own digital currency that acts as a better version of a Petro dollar backed by tokenized instruments yielding an excess return. </p>
