                  Our strategy is a financial component of our Blockchain
                  Ecosystem designed to give investors access to a diversified
                  basket of new kinds of digital asset classes.

                <p>
                  We felt that because a proper crypto index fund currently does
                  not yet exist in the United States, we believed we should
                  create one. Our next generation of cryptographic currency,
                  described as digital assets, comprises registered and legal
                  merchant coins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2022, our team is s pioneering the first merchant coin
                  backed by Silver as an S&P index that operates within an
                  Industry Sector, Exchanged Trading Fund (ETF), at the Industry
                  Group level, essentially becoming an autonomous 'merchant
                  coin-as-an-index.â€™
                </p>
                <p>
                  A merchant coin is a more cost-effective way of buying and
                  selling security tokens offered by Companies that participate
                  in a Direct Public Offering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It allows you to view the Sub Industry within each of the 11
                  Industry Sectors without having to open a position on each
                  security token. Trading on a merchant coin index can also help
                  spread some risks, as you aren't exposed to a single company's
                  security tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We buy the underlying silver-backed assets to establish the
                  merchant coin. There are no broker fees, no exit fees, no
                  minimum investment, and complete control over your assets.
                  Full blockchain transparency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By moving between merchant coins with the best value ratio,
                  participants will maximize the relationship between a "value
                  floor" determined by the Silver combined with speculative
                  value and assets under management.
